                        <h3>INTENT</h3>
                        <p>Loaves, Fishes & Computers (LFC) believes that respectful, professional conduct furthers our
                            mission, promotes productivity, minimizes disputes, and enhances our reputation. LFC expects
                            every volunteer and employee to show respect for all of our colleagues, clients, and vendors.
                            Harassment by volunteers, employees, or any third parties is a form of misconduct that degrades
                            our environment and undermines the integrity of LFC’s relationship with the community. LFC is
                            committed to providing a work environment that is free of unlawful discrimination, including
                            harassment that is based on any legally protected status. LFC will not tolerate any form of
                            discrimination or harassment that violates this policy.

                        <p>We will provide a safe and pleasant environment where everyone is treated with fairness and
                            respect. It is against LFC policy for any volunteer or employee to verbally or physically harass
                            or discriminate against another volunteer/ client on the basis of an individual’s race, color,

                            discriminatory action and any welcome or unwelcome conduct that is inflicted on someone because
                            of that individual’s protected status. Among the types of conduct prohibited by this policy are
                            epithets, slurs, jokes, negative stereotyping, intimidating acts, and the circulation or posting
                            of written or graphic materials that show hostility toward individuals because of their
                            protected status. LFC prohibits that conduct in the shop, even if the conduct is not
                            sufficiently severe or pervasive to constitute unlawful harassment.

                        <p>Sexual harassment is defined as unwelcome sexual advances; requests for sexual favors and other
                            verbal or physical conduct where:</p>
                        <li>Submission to such conduct is either an explicit or implicit condition of commitment or
                            employment
                        </li>
                        <li>Submission to, or rejection of, such conduct is used as the basis for decisions affecting the
                            person involved
                        </li>
                        <li>Such conduct has the purpose or effect of substantially interfering with an individual’s work

                    <div>
                        <p>This policy forbids harassment based on gender regardless of whether the offensive conduct is
                            sexual in nature and regardless of whether it rises to the level of a legal violation. Any
                            unwelcome conduct based on gender is also forbidden by this policy regardless of whether the
                            individual engaged in harassment and the individual being harassed are of the same or are of
                            different genders.</p>
